# Mayushii Bot

### Set up

Import the project as a maven project.

Create a folder called secret.txt in the project root directory. Inside this folder paste your bots secret key.

If you already have a (or a few) folders for a previous bot that contains all your audio files you can link it to this bot by running it with the path to the folder as a command line argument.
e.g. java -jar mayushii-bot.jar "C:/Users/Admin/Dropbox/Discord Soundboard 1" "C:/Users/Admin/Dropbox/Discord Soundboard 2"
